# Project: Battleship

Welcome to my implementation of the classic **Battleship** game! This is a browser-based game where you can play either against a friend or against the AI (single-player mode). Players take turns attacking each other's ships, trying to sink them before their own fleet is sunk.

### 1. **Game Setup:**

The game starts with the player inputting their name and selecting whether they want to play **single-player** or **two-player**. The default screen shows input boxes for player names and a checkbox for single-player. Once submitted, players can proceed to the board to arrange their ships.

### 2. **Drag and Rotate Ships:**

Here, players can drag ships around the gameboard and place them in their desired positions. Clicking on a ship allows players to **rotate** it if space allows.

### 3. **Game in Progress:**

Players take turns targeting tiles on their opponent's board. This screenshot shows some tiles that have been **hit** and some ships that have been **sunk**, which are highlighted for easy tracking.

### 4. **End Game Dialog:**

When the game ends, a dialog box appears over each game board, signaling the **winner** and **loser** of the game. In the above screenshot **Player 2** is the loser because all of their ships have been sunk.
